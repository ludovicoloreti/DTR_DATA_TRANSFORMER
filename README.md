# DTR DATA TRANSFORMER

Transform text reports by DTR scan (`docker scan`) in JSON and CSV; 

The `docker scan` with the `--json` tag will not have all the data inside but only the shallow data.
Here you can find Shallow and Deep data:
-  The first is what the DTR finds scanning the surface of the docker image; 
-  The second is what DTR finds scanning in-deep the docker image.

## BEFORE INSTALLATION

Before being able to run it, you need to create a NIST API KEY. 
To do so, you have to go here **[NIST - Request an API Key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)**

Then create a *`.env`* file inside the root directory and put this content inside:

```
NIST_API_KEY="{YOUR API KEY}"
```

Remember to change **`{YOUR API KEY}`** to your API key downloaded from the NIST website.

## INSTALL

`npm install`


## RUN

`node docker_scan_transformer.js -f FILENAME.extension`

### Other info

**Remember to keep the "export" folder, where files generated by the script will be located.**

If you want to compare the DTR scan with the Tenable.io scan just do:

`node dtr_tenable_comparison.js -t TENABLE-FILENAME.json -d DTR-FILENAME.FileExtension`
