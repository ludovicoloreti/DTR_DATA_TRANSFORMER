# DTR DATA TRANSFORMER

Transform text reports by DTR scan (`docker scan`) in JSON and CSV; 

The `docker scan` with the `--json` tag will not have all the data inside but only the shallow data.
Here you can find Shallow and Deep data:
-  The first is what the DTR finds scanning the surface of the docker image; 
-  The second is what DTR finds scanning in-deep the docker image.

## INSTALL

IF there is _package-lock.json_: 

`npm ci`

OR, 

IF there is *NOT* _package-lock.json_: 

`npm install`

## RUN

`node docker_scan_transformer.js -f FILENAME.extension`

### Other info

Remember to keep the "export" folder, where files generated by the script will be located.

If you want to compare the DTR scan with the Tenable.io scan just do:

`node dtr_tenable_comparison.js -t TENABLE-FILENAME.FileExtension -d DTR-FILENAME.FileExtension`
